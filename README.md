# Kickstarter-Predictor

This is a project for COMP-3800 Data Science at Wentworth Institute of Technology

The goal of this project was to use [the kickstarter dataset](https://webrobots.io/kickstarter-datasets/) to create a machine learning model to predict the success of a kickstrarter project. The project uses the Random Forrest Classifier to predict the success. It also uses reddit's PRAW API to gather social media data in order to improve the accuracy of the model. 

There is more explenation of strategies and methods used in the Jupyter Notebook.

The Final Accuracy Score is 72%
